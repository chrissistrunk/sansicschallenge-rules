Robert M Lee with SANS ICS started a new challenge in 2015 that focuses on Industrial Control Systems.

In this challenge, participants had to create a YARA rule and another type of IOC rule for detecting malware, and a SNORT rule detecting maliciousness in a pcap.

I wanted to post my rules that I submitted in the challenge here for a reference.
